HI Bita --

  Hear are some notes I have noticed:
  
     1) I have noticed that you haven't checked for the user typing in ( for example ) song numbers incorrectly
        like entering a string "xxx" instead of "1".  I have made an exapmle correction for when the user enters
        a "menu selection".
     2 ) Along with the suggestion to use ArrayList,  I would also suggest using the Streams and Lambda expressions.
     3 ) Also wondering about why you had a main() in MyTunes to run tests and you didn't have a main()
         in MyPlayList to run test.
     
     3 ) Also wondering about why you didn't create a MyPlayList App with a dedicated main()
     4 ) You could have created MyPlayList such that you passed it a Reader so that you could run tests (
         by creating a FileReader of a text file containing tests to run).  And you also you could also pass
         a Writer to store the tests results.
         
         like:
         MyPlayList pl = new MyPlayList( System.out, System.in );
         and
         MyPlayList pl = new MyPlayList( new FileReader( "mplTest.txt" ), new FileWriter( "mplTestOut.txt") );
